# State of the Art: Singular Value Decomposition

In 2016, [Dario](https://github.com/dariomx) and I were enrolled in a "Parallel and Distributed Computing" course, lectured by Prof. Isaac D. Scherson, from the University of California, Irvine. For the final project, we studied the theory behind SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) in search of a topic for our Master's thesis. We compiled our _State of the Art_ assessment in this document.
